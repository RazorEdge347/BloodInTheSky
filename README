#BloodInTheSky

The project "Blood In The Sky" is an adventure game / action RPG /
Hack-and-Slash, which is situated in a Dark fantasy world, where the
core feature includes a level system in which the player, 
starts at the beginning with his stats maxed out but will get weaker
in each level , if the player so desires.

The game was developed on "Unreal Engine 4" where the game utilized
some of the free assets that Unreal Marketplace offers.
